This first assignment involved solving the classic artificial intelligence problem of the 8-tile puzzle. Although there are better solutions this program uses Depth First Search(DFS)
to search all possible states and chooses the path that leads to the given goal. 

**Note:** the requirements of the assignment listed that the program needed to be both functional and recursive. Python is more dynamic. So if the code looks like a complicated 
Lisp program that was translated into Python that is the reason.
